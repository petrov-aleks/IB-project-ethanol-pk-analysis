# Biostatistical Analysis of Ethanol Pharmacokinetics

This project investigates ethanol pharmacokinetics using biostatistical modeling approaches. We assessed the influence of multiple covariates on key pharmacokinetic parameters by fitting linear regression models.

The analysis was conducted in two stages. First, we explored models aimed at maximizing the coefficient of determination (R²). Second, we focused on a predefined set of factors of primary interest: body weight (using three alternative metrics), sex, and feeding status.

Additionally, we evaluated allometric scaling approaches using both classical power exponents and exponents proposed by Matsumoto to assess their applicability to ethanol pharmacokinetics.
